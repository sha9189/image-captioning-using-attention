This project is an attempt in creating an Image Caption Generator using Attention mechanism. It is still in progress. These are the achievements so far:

1. Implemented attention

2. Used BLEU Score for evaluating model performance.

3. Implemented Beam Search Algorithm for improved caption quality.

4. Used pretraining GloVe word vector and reduced training time by 50%.

5. Trained on a dataset of 150k image-caption pairs using Flickr30k Dataset.
